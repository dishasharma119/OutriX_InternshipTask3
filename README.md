The goal of this project was to create a fully responsive landing page for the brand Genipix using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The design focuses on a clean, modern layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. The landing page includes a Hero section to introduce the brand, a Features section to highlight key offerings, a Testimonials section to build trust, and a Footer with essential links and contact details. The project emphasized responsive design principles, mobile-first development, and the use of Bootstrapâ€™s grid system for easy scalability.
